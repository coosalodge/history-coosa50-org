The Order of the Arrow, in its focus on service, operates five high adventure programs on the national level, each of which focuses on conservation. These programs occur at the three national high adventure bases. They are only open to youth aged 16 to 20 and are available at a substantially lower price than other programs at these high adventure bases.
