The Distinguished Service Award was created in 1940 to honor those who rendered service to the Order beyond the lodge level. The award is presented to those Arrowmen who have rendered distinguished and outstanding service to the Order on a sectional, regional, or national basis. The award is presented every two to three years during the National Order of the Arrow Conference. Since the time the first awards were presented, less than 840 Distinguished Service Awards have been awarded.

The award is a sterling silver arrowhead, bearing an arrow pointing upward and to the wearer’s right, suspended from a white neck-ribbon upon which are embroidered red arrows. A white square knot embroidered upon red cloth is also available. Presentation of the award is limited; nominations are open to both youth and adult.

### 2012 - James Tarbox

James was inducted into Coosa Lodge in 2001 at Camp Sequoyah. He then served in nearly every aspect of the Lodge, including ceremonies, shows, the kitchen, and the trading post, before being elected as Coosa Lodge’s only two-term Lodge Chief on his way to back-to-back elections as SR-6S and SR-9 Section Chief.  James’ experience with Coosa Shows and his success as Section Chief opened the door for him to serve as the Shows CVC at the 2009 National Order of the Arrow Conference, where he led dozens of Arrowmen in successfully planning and executing four exciting and inspirational arena shows.  James is an Eagle Scout, a James E. West fellow, a 2005 Vigil Honor recipient, and a recipient of the Founder’s Award in 2007.

### 2015 - Mr. Richard Gregory ("Greg") Moore

Greg was a Vigil Honor recipient and Lodge Chief of Atta Kulla Kulla Lodge as a youth before joining Cherokee Fifty many years later. Greg was prominent during the consolidation process, emerging as our first Nominations and Recognition committee adviser and one of our first Associate Lodge Advisers. After Dr. James Flatt stepped down as Lodge Adviser, Greg was chosen to succeed him.

After four years of service as Lodge Adviser, Greg resigned that post and was asked to serve as an Associate Section Adviser for Section SR-9. During his time as Associate Section Adviser, Greg found new opportunities to serve Scouting across SR-9 and the Southern Region.

Greg served as the Deputy Lead Adviser for the Day of Service Messengers of Peace program at the 2013 National Jamboree. He has also served on several staffs for national events such as NOAC, SummitCorps, and multiple NLATS Courses.
