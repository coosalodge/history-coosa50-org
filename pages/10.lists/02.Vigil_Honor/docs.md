The Vigil Honor is the highest honor that may be bestowed on a member of the Order of the Arrow. It is given, not earned. Each lodge may petition the National Order of the Arrow to 
bestow the Vigil on a group of its members. To be eligible, an Arrowman must be registered in good standing with a unit or the council, be a current dues-paid member of the lodge, and 
be a Brotherhood member for a minimum of two years.

Recipients of the Vigil Honor are selected based on their dedication and continued service to the lodge, the Order of the Arrow, the Scouting community, and/or a scout camp.

The Vigil Honor Selection Committee operates as part of the Nominations and Recognitions Committee.
