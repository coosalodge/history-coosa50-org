Achunanchi Lodge 135 was located in Anniston, Alabama as part of the Choccolocco Council #1. It was formally chartered on September 29, 1938 and held its first Ordeal in 1940 with the help of Cherokee Lodge 50. The word Achunanchi is Choctaw, which means “Young Wise Men”. The first totem of the Lodge was an Owl but later changed to a Thunderbird.

The Lodge was known for its service and dedication to its Camps. Originally the Lodge operated out of Camp Zinn near Anniston and then moved in late 1964 to Comer Scout Reservation near Mentone, AL. A seven acre lake at Camp Comer is named Lake Achunanchi in honor of the Arrowmen who helped build the new Camp. Their efforts and financial contributions are still felt to this day as Camp Comer is the center of operations for Coosa Lodge.

Achunanchi attended all Area/Section Conferences from 1952 to 1999. Camp Zinn hosted conferences in 1958 and 1961. In 1966, 1970, 1975, 1982, 1989, and 1992 were hosted at Camp Comer. The Lodge serviced 11 counties in the northeast corner of Alabama and was known for their Dance Teams and Trail Service work. The DeSoto Scout Trail; Thunderbird Trail, Odum Scout Trail, and Chinnabee Trail were all completed in part due to the work of the Arrowmen of Achunanchi Lodge.
