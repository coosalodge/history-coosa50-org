Cherokee Lodge 50 of the Birmingham Area Council and later the Central Alabama Council was formally chartered on June 17, 1930. Cherokee Fifty was the first lodge chartered in Alabama and the first south of the Mason-Dixon Line. It had the largest membership in the state while occupying only two counties - Jefferson and Shelby. It had a rich history which includes many Arrowmen who branched out to other Councils to help form new lodges there.

The first Ordeal for the Lodge was held at the old Camp Andrews near present day Hoover, Alabama in 1931. The Charter Members of the lodge are Dr. J. A. Anderson; John Tillia; Billy Caruthers; Brad Wood; Carson Hood; Frank Braden; and Stanley Mate. They were the first initiated members of the Order of the Arrow in Alabama.

The Lodge name “Cherokee” was chosen for the Cherokee Indians that once inhabited the local area around Birmingham. They were one of the five civilized tribes in Alabama and brought great Native American heritage with their name. The Lodge totem was adopted in 1946 and pictured a Thunderbird with the head of an “Ivory Billed Woodpecker” once common to the area but now extinct.

In 1939, Cherokee Lodge hosted the first Regional O.A. Conference at Camp Andrews. The goal of this original conference was to spur interest in the Order of the Arrow through regional Councils. In these early years, Cherokee assisted many Lodges in the Southeast with their organization and ceremonies. Cherokee Fifty helped start Achunanchi 135 in Anniston, AL; Alibamu 179 in Montgomery, AL and Aracoma 481 in Tuscaloosa, AL. Cherokee was a Charter Member of Area V-A that included all lodges in Alabama except Kaskanampo 310.

Cherokee Lodge was present at all Regional and Sectional OA Conferences from 1950 through 1999. The Lodge hosted conferences in 1954, 1960 and 1967 at Camp Indian Valley; 1974 and 1981 at Camp Sequoyah; and 1988 at Camp Winnataska - their last hosted conclave. Cherokee Fifty held activities at four Camps - Camp Arrowhead through 1971; Camp Indian Valley; Camp Sequoyah and Camp Winnataska. The Lodge was also home of over 16 Area/Section Chiefs or Vice-Chiefs. H. Lloyd Nelson the National Order of the Arrow Chairman was a brief member of the Lodge from 1953 until his passing in 1955.

The Lodge was also home to two Distinguished Service Award Honorees - Mr. James Johnson in 1981 and former Lodge Adviser Mr. Ken Ackerman in 1983. Cherokee was alos nationally known for their Dance Team under the direction of “Chief” Zach Cross. Chief Cross was the third Vigil Honoree in Alabama, keeping his Vigil at Camp Tukabatchee in 1952. He went on to a lifelong career as a Professional Scouter and made the Dance Teams through the Lodge know nationwide.
