Introduced at the 1981 National Order of the Arrow Conference, the Founder's Award was created to honor and recognize those Arrowmen who have given outstanding service to their lodge. The
award is reserved for an Arrowman who demonstrates to fellow Arrowmen that he or she memorializes in his or her everyday life the spirit of achievement as described by founder E. Urner Goodman
and co-founder Carroll A. Edson.

The Award is a bronze medallion bearing the likenesses of E. Urner Goodman and cofounder Carroll A. Edson, with wooden base and brass plate suitable for engraving. Also available is a special
Founder's Award arrow ribbon, with a gold colored arrow suspended from a red ribbon. This award is presented annually.
