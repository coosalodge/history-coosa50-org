As members of the Order of the Arrow, we are uniquely obligated to "observe and preserve" our history and traditions. As such, for the Order 
of the Arrow's centennial celebration, each lodge was charged by the National Order of the Arrow Committee to create and share a history book. 
For a number of different reasons, that particular project was never really finished.

Our goal here is simple: We want to create a single, authoritative, comprehensive historical record of Coosa Lodge and the legacy lodges that it was 
built upon: Cherokee Lodge #50, Achunanchi Lodge #135, and Kaskanampo Lodge #310.

If you want to help, there are a few ways you can do so:

* **Share your story!** We can collect a written essay or record an oral history to add your story to our growing collection. Your personal history 
can help fill the gaps in our timelines and add a personal touch to the written record of events from the past.

* **Donate materials to the collection!** We'd love to see the old patches, photos, newsletter, meeting minutes, rosters, reports, and anything else 
that you might have. If you want to keep these keepsakes, we'll be glad to digitize them and return them. If you're ready to give them a new home, 
we'll be happy to add them to our permanent collection.

* **Join the team!** We have a lot of work to do and we can always use a helping hand.

If you have any questions or want to help us out, send an email to our Lodge History Adviser, Mr. Chris Brightwell 
([chris@dimwell.net](mailto:chris@dimwell.net)).
